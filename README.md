# Ruby-projects
I'm learning Ruby, so here are the programs I'm making to learn.
==> Donald Duckify - transform sentences as if Donald Duck said them.
==> cats and dogs - based on the values you choose for cats and dogs, it'll say whose better or if they're equally great.
==> Who are you? - it takes user input, capitalizes appropriately, and puts the info together into 1 introductory sentence.
