I'm learning Ruby, so here are the programs I'm making to learn.<br>
  ==> Who are you? - it takes user input, capitalizes appropriately, and puts the info together into 1 introductory sentence.<br>
  ==> cats and dogs - based on the values you choose for cats and dogs, it'll say who's better or if they're equally great.<br>
  ==> Donald Duckify - transform sentences as if Donald Duck said them.<br>
  ==> while, until, for - looping the same string of numbers (1-50) with while, until, and for.<Br>
  ==> redacted - user inputs text and chooses a word to redact, the program will then redact it.<br>
  ==> word counter - user inputs words, a sentence, whatever, and this will count how many times words come up.<br>
  ==> methods - greets the user by name AND if a number is evenly divisible by 3, it says it's true. if it's not, it says it's false.<br>
  ==> sorting - sorts strings and numbers in ascending and descending order.
