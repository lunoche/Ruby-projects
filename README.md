I'm learning Ruby, so here are the programs I'm making to learn.<br>
  ==> Who are you? - it takes user input, capitalizes appropriately, and puts the info together into 1 introductory sentence.<br>
  ==> cats and dogs - based on the values you choose for cats and dogs, it'll say who's better or if they're equally great.<br>
  ==> Donald Duckify - transform sentences as if Donald Duck said them.<br>
  ==> while, until, for - Looping the same string of numbers (1-50) with while, until, and for.
